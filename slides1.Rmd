# Research Methods in Finance and Accounting

## Introduction

<div class="content_slide">
- Preparation to do empirical research (in accounting and finance)
- From theory to data
- From data to statistical tests
</div>

<div class="notes">
The emphasis on the units will be on the practical and statistical issues of
the data analysis part of a thesis. The influence will not be on the accounting
and finance part of your thesis. The goal is to be relevant to everyone in the
unit.
</div>

## Four Modules

<div class="content_slide">
1. The research process and basic data skills by me
2. Timeseries and databases by Prof. Dirk Bauer
3. Panel data and identification by Prof. Jing Yang
4. Restricted dependent variable and survey data by Prof. Paul Gerrans
</div>

<div class="notes">
All modules work as stand-alone 3-week units and aim to cover a wide
range of topics. Not all of them will in the end be relevant for everyone. 
However, it is probably a good idea to get to know the different statistical
methods, their advantages, and disadvantages. Bringing a new methodology to 
an old topic can be a valuable contribution. Some problems have already been
solved in other research streams.
</div>

## Assessment

<div class="content_slide">
- No Exam
- Four assignments (%)
- Proposal and presentation (%) 
</div>

<div class="notes">
We want you to (1) do some data analysis and (2) be well prepared to undertake
(the data analaysis part of) a research project. So we are going to evaluate 
you by letting you (1) analyse data and (2) prepare your honours thesis. 
</div>

# The first three weeks: CEO compensation
## Warning: I am not a specialist

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/342/ihave.jpg")
```

<div class="notes">
I am not a specialist in the topic nor in this type of data analysis. CEO
compensation is something that people in finance, accounting, economics, and
outside of academia are interested in. The topic is probably the one with the
most commonality. I am comforable with these type of economic theories and I am
going to stress the role of theory in data analysis a lot. Some of you will have
a topic that is at first sight less theory driven or rely more strongly on very
specific knowledge about your setting. I am going to try to convince you that it
is going to be useful to think about the underlying story that you are testing.
</div>

## Topic

<div class="content_slide">
Completely based on ["Executive Compensation: A Modern Primer"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jel.20161153) by Alex Edmans and
Xavier Gabraix in *Journal of Economic Literature*.

- The level of CEO compensation
- CEO incentives
</div>

<div class="notes">
I am going to focus on two topics.

1. How high can we expect the total compensation of a CEO to be (compared to 
   other CEOs) based on some simple economic assumptions. Too high CEO 
   compensation is sometimes seen as a signal of bad corporate goverance. 
   To measure what 'too high' means, we first need to establish a baseline of
   normal levels of compensation.
2. How should CEOs be incentivised: equity or options? How schould we measure
   whether CEOs have appropriate incentives: \$ for \$ increases, % for % 
   increases? Incentives are a big topic in 
</div>

## Theory

### Firm production function

<div class="content_slide">
\[
V = T^{\alpha_T} \Bigl( \frac{K}{\alpha_K} \Bigl)^{\alpha_K}
                 \Bigl( \frac{L}{\alpha_L} \Bigl)^{\alpha_L}
\\
\alpha_T + \alpha_K + \alpha_L = 1
\]
</div>

<div class="notes">
- $V =$ The value of the firm
- $K =$ Capital of the firm
- $L =$ Labour of the firm
- $T =$ CEO talent/skills/ability/experience

We assume that there is nothing in the structure of the production function that
favours a particular firm size, i.e. constant returns to scale 
($\alpha_T + \alpha_K + \alpha_L = 1$). 
</div>

### CEO decision

<div class="content_slide">
\[
W_T = \max_{K, L} V - w_L L - rK
\]
</div>

<div class="notes">
The CEO maximises their income $W_T$ by attracting capital at a cost, $r$, and
and hiring labour at a wage, $w_L$. The model assumes that the CEO takes the 
ultimate decision. As it turns out when you assume competitive labour and 
financial markets, that assumptions does not really matter a lot.
</div>

<div class="notes">
This model is too simple to capture reality perfectly. However, that is not the
goal of the model and of this exercise. The idea is to see whether we can find
a reasonable baseline for CEO compensation that we can test against the data.
</div>

## Relation between size and CEO wage

<div class="content_slide">
\[
W_T = \alpha_T V
\]

> In this model, the driving force is that more talented CEOs grow the business
> to a bigger size and they earn more money when they create more value.

</div>

<div class="notes">
First find the optimal level of capital  ...
\[
\frac{\partial V}{\partial K} =  T^{\alpha_T}  
\Bigl( \frac{K}{\alpha_K} \Bigl)^{\alpha_K - 1} 
\Bigl( \frac{L}{\alpha_L} \Bigl)^{\alpha_L} - r = 0
\\
T^{\alpha_T} \Bigl( \frac{K}{\alpha_K} \Bigl)^{\alpha_K} 
\Bigl( \frac{L}{\alpha_L} \Bigl)^{\alpha_L}
\frac{\alpha_K}{K}
= r 
\\
\frac{V}{r} = \frac{K}{\alpha_K}
\]
... and labour
\[
\frac{\partial V}{\partial K} =  T^{\alpha_T}  
\Bigl( \frac{K}{\alpha_K} \Bigl)^{\alpha_K} 
\Bigl( \frac{L}{\alpha_L} \Bigl)^{\alpha_L - 1} - w_L
\\
T^{\alpha_T} \Bigl( \frac{K}{\alpha_K} \Bigl)^{\alpha_K} 
\Bigl( \frac{L}{\alpha_L} \Bigl)^{\alpha_L}
\frac{\alpha_L}{L} = w_L
\\
\frac{V}{w_L} = \frac{L}{\alpha_L}
\]

Now we can plugin $L$ and $K$ in $V$ ...

\[
V = T^{\alpha_T} \Bigl( \frac{V}{r} \Bigl) ^{\alpha_K} 
\Bigl( \frac{V}{w_L} \Bigl) ^{\alpha_L} 
\\
V^{1 - \alpha_K - \alpha_L} = \frac{T^{\alpha_T}}
{r^{\alpha_K} w_L^{\alpha_L}}
\\
V^{\alpha_T} = \frac{T^{\alpha_T}}
{r^{\alpha_K} w_L^{\alpha_L}}
\\
V = \frac{T}
{r^{\frac{\alpha_K}{\alpha_T}} w_L^{\frac{\alpha_L}{\alpha_T}}}
\]

... and in $W_T$.

\[
W_T = V - V \alpha_K - V\alpha_L = (1 - \alpha_K - \alpha_L) V = \alpha_T V
\]

I like the basic intuition and deriviation of the model. The derivation is
straightforward and (some of) the implicit assumptions are relatively easy to
accept. The effect of the CEO depends on the size of the firm ($V$). When there
is more capital and labour available a more talented CEO will have a bigger
impact. The model also predicts a clear quantitative relationship between firm
size, $V$, and CEO compensation, $W_T$, i.e. that relationship should be 
linear. This is a nice result that we can test with data. In contrast to the
linear relationship between firm size and CEO talent. We can measure $V$ but not
$T$.

<div class="notes">
The data is downloaded from Compustat and Execucomp. A lot of you will use
these are similar databases in your research project. I did not clean or check
the data for this exercise. In your own project, you should show a better 
understanding of how the data are gathered and what they include than what I
am displaying here.

- CEO compensation is fairly complete. It includes changes in the value of 
  equity and options.
- Market value also includes all outstanding financial instruments on the 
  company. 

The qualitative relationship holds quite well. Bigger companies have CEOs with
higher compensation. However, the relationship is far from linear and looks more
like a power function. Clearly there are other effects at play. In this sample, 
the power coefficient is 0.23. Prior studies have found a coefficient 
more closely to 0.33 (Baker, Jensen, and Murphy 1988). Remember that in our
setup the CEO can grow the firm at will by attracting more capital and more
labour. That assumption is probably too strong.
</div>

## The research process

<div class="content_slide">
- Make assumptions
- Derive relationship between measurable quantities
- Compare the theory and the data
</div>

<div class="notes">
Note what we have just done. We started with some assumptions about the
production function of a company and competitive markets to find the 
theoretical relation between firm size and CEO compensation. We followed up by
testing this theory to data from S&P500 firms. These are the steps that you
should be following.
</div>

# Details of the research process

## Literature search

<div class="content_slide">
- https://www.scholar.google.com
- https://onesearch.library.uwa.edu.au
- https://apps.webofknowledge.com
- [EBSCOhost Research Databases](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.asp?defaultdb=bth&lang=en)
- https://ssrn.com/en/
- https://www.nber.org/papers.html
</div>  

<div class="notes">
In the CEO compensation case above, we derived the theoretical prediction.
Normally, you will build on prior theoretical and empirical research to build
predictions. The

In most cases (ssrn is the exception), you will have to be on the university's
network if you want to actually read the full paper. 

- Google Scholar is probably the most comprehensive repository. This search 
  engine work very similar to regular Google search. There are some additional
  tricks you can use "author:lastname-firstname" will help you to narrow down
  papers from a specific author. "intitle:keyword" let's you search for keywords
  in the title of papers. You can also narrow down your search based on year
  of publication. The advanced search features hidden in the left side bar give
  you additional options such as searching for certain journals. If you are
  on the university network, Google Scholar will tell you for every paper 
  whether it is accessible or not. 
- Onesearch is the university search engine. It's the best way to figure out 
  whether there is an easily accessible version of the paper.
- Webofknowledge and EBSCOhost are two publisher driven initiatives. They work
  pretty well. Each with their own quirks. 
- SSRN (Social Science Research Network) and NBER (National Bureau of Economic
  Research) both provide access to their own not-yet-peer-reviewed paper 
  repositories. Here you go to find cutting edge research.
</div>

## Start of literature search

<div class="content_slide">
- Don't start too narrow! 
- Review(s) articles and journals
    - Journal of Economic Literature
    - Journal of Accounting Literature
- A*/A journals
    - [Accounting](http://www.abdc.edu.au/master-journal-list.php?title=&issn=&for=3&rating=A*)
    - [Finance](http://www.abdc.edu.au/master-journal-list.php?title=&issn=&for=4&rating=A*)
</div>

<div class="notes">
My favourite way to start a research project now is to find one or two excellent
overview or review papers. A (systematic) review paper provides a state of a
research field and identifies interesting new research questions. I am not sure
whether my strategy will work for you. I find that a good review paper gives a
good list of papers you can build on and they often already compare the most
important papers in a field. The trick is to be not too picky. You probably
will not find a review for your exact reserch problem but it is unlikely that
you will not find a partly relevant overview paper. You can search for review
papers by adding "intitle:review" or "intitle:overview" to your Google Scholar
search.

To find other papers relevant to your topic, you can build on the review paper 
by (1) looking up the papers referred to in the review paper and (2) search
for papers that cite the review paper. You can do the latter via Google Scholar
and Webofknowledge.

To find good reviews, I think you should start your search in the better 
journals. Some journals are dedicated to these literature reviews for instance
*Journal of Economic Literature* and *Journal of Accounting Literature*. I am
not aware of a similar journal in finance but I will happily add it if you
let me know. 

When you start your literature search, you don't want to narrow. You are not 
going to find an overview paper about "CEO compensation in Australian mining 
companies after the GFC". However, you can start with an overview paper about
CEO compensation. Like the one I found:  ["Executive Compensation: A Modern
Primer"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jel.20161153) by Alex Edmans and Xavier
Gabraix in *Journal of Economic Literature*.

## Data analysis tools

<div class="content_slide">
- [Install R](https://cran.curtin.edu.au/)
- [Install Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)

> I will help you with any questions about these tools during your honours year.
> We will only scratch the surface in the first three weeks.

</div>

<div class="notes">
- R is free software specifically aimed at statistical analysis and graphical
  representation. It is a fully developed programming language that allows to
  extend it with new packages with new capabilities. We are going to heavily
  rely on some of those packages. You can save the different steps in your 
  analysis in an R script which is just a plain text file with the 
  ".R"-extenstion. 
- Rstudio is an integrated development environment for R. It allows you to
  easily write, test, and run R code, and integrate the results with 
  explanations. One advantage of R and Rstudio is that you can install them on 
  as many computers as you want. You do not need a special license. 
- RMarkdown is an R extension of the markdown format. The idea of markdown is to
  write plain text documents which can later be exported to other formats such
  as html, pdf, or word. The advantage of plain text scripts and markdown. 
  The beauty of RMarkdown is that it lets you combine both R scripts and
  markdown into one document. These slides and lecturenotes are generated from
  one underlying document. I will not be asking you to anything like that but it
  does illustrate the power of the RMarkdown approach. 
- Finally, I am going to introduce you to a specific dialect of the R language
  which is informally known as the tidyverse. You will see later why. If you
  want to be a good R programmer this might not be the best entry point into R.
  However, I assume that you want to quickly pick up some tools to facilitate
  your research project and for that purpose I believe the tidyverse will 
  be excellent. I will introduce the most important bits and pieces throughout
  my lectures however I don't have the time to go into detail. Now and then, you
  will have to experiment on your own a get your code working. An excellent
  resource is the free online book "R for datascience". You can also buy 
  reasonably priced physical copies if you your are interested in developing 
  your R skills further. 
</div>

## The R console

<div class="content_slide">
```{r console, echo=TRUE}
x = 1
x
x = x + 1
x
```
</div>

<div class="notes">
You can directly type your R code in the console. The little code above
already shows you two things.

- You can assign (and overwrite) a numerical value to an object `x`
- The right-hand side is assigned to the left-hand side. You can't just
  switch them around.
</div>

## R packages

<div class="content_slide">
```{r packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
```
</div>

<div class="notes">
We will heavily rely on two packages. `tidyverse` is a package that helps
with data transformations and working with tabular data in a tidy fashion. 
`ggplot2` provides tools to make pretty plots. 

The code also gives you an idea how to install packages and use them. Normally,
you will only have to install a package once. However, when you want to use a
package in your script or code, you will have to load the package with the 
`library()` function. You only have to do load a package once at the start of
your R session or at the start of your script.

I would advise you to use the console for only two purposes. 

1. To test your script by running part of your code or showing intermediate
   values to check whether your code is doing what you think it should be
   doing.
2. To install packages and do R(Studio) maintenance.

For real work, you are better off writing an R script and running that script
in RStudio. Further on, I will show you how to do that.

## The dplyr verbs to explore and transform data.

<div class="content_slide">
- `filter()`
- `select()`
- `mutate()`
- `group_by()` and `summarise()`
- `%>%`
</div>

<div class="notes">
These functions will be your main tools to filter observations in your data,
select different variables, mutate variables, group observations and summarise
the variables in the groups. The pype operator, `%>%`, lets you glue these
different verbs together.
